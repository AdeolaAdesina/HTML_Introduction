# HTML_Introduction
HTML is the backbone of the Web. The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.

HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language:

A markup language is a computer language that defines the structure and presentation of raw text.

In HTML, the computer can interpret raw text that is wrapped in HTML elements.
HyperText is text displayed on a computer or device that provides access to other text through links, also known as hyperlinks. You probably clicked on a couple of hyperlinks on your way to this Codecademy course.
Learning HTML is the first step in creating websites, but even a bit of knowledge can help you inject code snippets into newsletter, blog or website templates. As you continue learning, you can layer HTML with CSS and JavaScript to create visually compelling and dynamic websites. But for now, we’re going to focus on how to add and modify basic content on a page, like text, images, and videos. Don’t worry if the websites look ugly — we’re just getting started.

In this introductory session, you will be getting started with buiding mini websites with HTML.

First steps:

-Open a new folder and name it 'HTML'.
-Inside this folder, create text document(with notepad) and name it index.txt
-Now open index.txt and write the following code:

```
<html>
</html>
```

This is an opened HTML tag and closed HTML tag. Every website on the internet starts with an opened and closed HTML tag.

Next give it an head and body tag:

```
<html>
<head>
</head>
<body>
</body>
</html>
```

Notice how we open a tag with <> and close the tag with </>

Now inside the head tag, let's give it a title tag:

```
<html>
<head>
<title>
My first site
</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>
Welcome to my first Website.

</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

Now save the index.txt file.

Next us the 'save as' option and save as index.html.

This will create a webpage in the HTML folder. Go to the folder and click on the web page.

Congratulations, you just designed your first web page.

# HTML Anatomy

The diagram to the right displays an HTML paragraph element. As we can see, the paragraph element is made up of:

An opening tag (<p>)
The content (“Hello World!” text)
A closing tag (</p>)

A tag and the content between it is called an HTML element. 

There are many tags that we can use to organize and display text and other types of content, like images.
