# HTML_Introduction
HTML is the backbone of the Web. The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.

In this introductory session, you will be getting started with buiding mini websites with HTML.

First steps:

-Open a new folder and name it 'HTML'.
-Inside this folder, create text document(with notepad) and name it index.txt
-Now open index.txt and write the following code:

```
<html>
</html>
```

This is an opened HTML tag and closed HTML tag. Every website on the internet starts with an opened and closed HTML tag.

Next give it an head and body tag:

```
<html>
<head>
</head>
<body>
</body>
</html>
```

Notice how we open a tag with <> and close the tag with </>

Now inside the head tag, let's give it a title tag:

```
<html>
<head>
<title>
My first site
</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>
Welcome to my first Website.

</h1>
</body>
</html>
```
